1. Main TrustScore Formula (Major Change)

  Original:
  TrustScore = (0.6(FleetScore) + 0.4(Tail Score)) x Confidence Score

  Refined:
  TrustScore = (50+ (0.5*(0.6*OS + 0.4*TS))) * CS

  The refined version adds a baseline of 50 and scales the operator/tail score contribution by 0.5, which compresses the range and ensures a higher minimum score.

  2. FleetScore Display Formula (New Addition)

  Refined version adds:
  FleetScore = (50+0.5*OS) * CS

  This separate formula is explicitly defined for displaying FleetScores to users.

  3. Confidence Score Exponent

  Original:
  CS = 1-(e^-0.3y)

  Refined:
  CS = 1-(e^-0.384y)

  The exponent increased from 0.3 to 0.384, making the confidence score grow faster with operator age.

  4. Terminology Change

  Original: "FleetScore" (FS)
  Refined: "Raw OperatorScore" (OS)

  The naming was changed to better reflect that it measures the operator, not just the fleet.

  5. Financial Score Default Case (New Addition)

  Refined version adds:
  If no UCC data is available, FSF = 5.

  This provides a default score when financial data is unavailable, rather than leaving it undefined.

  The refined version primarily adjusts the scoring ranges to be less harsh (baseline of 50 with compressed scaling) and provides better handling of edge cases (missing UCC data).
